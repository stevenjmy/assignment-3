    <h1>Problem analysis: </h1>
     <br>
     <p>By analyzing the data from assignment 2, I found that most of the rich people in Sydney gathering above the latte line, which makes the people lives below the latte line disadvantage, so this will be the main problem I am trying to solve. Therefore, I am trying to find a solution to increase the number of rich people below the latte line. Moreover, there is a pay gap between male and female, male earns more than female, so I hope the solution I come up with for the main problem can also solve this problem. The latte line below clearly showing the main problem.</p)
 <br>
    <h1>Solution:</h1>
     <br>
    <p>By combining the data of education from Australian Bureau of Statistics and the universitiesâ€™ location in Sydney from google map, I think that education could be the way to solve the main problem.</p>
    <p>The graph on the left shows the rate of male and female who has not fully engaged in education and/or employment between 2006 and 2016. It is clearly showing that more female has not engage in education and/or employment than male. While the graph shows that plenty of universities are located around CBD.</p>

        <img src="university map.jpg" width="110" height="45" alt="image missing!" ></p>
    <p>Therefore, I am considering building a school combining with working place as a entire community somewhere below the latte line, so the place around the school could become another CBD which gives more opportunities for the people around that area.</p>
    <br>
     
    <h1>Location Selection:</h1>
     <br>
   <p>The location I selected is between Bankstown and Campsie, because there are two airports near the location, so it has a good transportation condition for the people live here, and most importantly, it is convenience for people living far from Sydney coming to this place to work and study. Moreover, the main rock type around this area is sedimentary rock, like sandstone and shale, so it should be strong enough to hold large buildings. The graph on the left shows the airport location, while the right one shows the rock types.</p>

     <br>
     <h1>Proposal Details:</h1>
     <br>
    <p>The idea of architecture form of the community based on jellyfish, which means the legs of jellyfish are used as the supports and head is for the community construction. The reason is that Sydney is near the sea, and there are lots of jellyfish found on the beach, so the form of architecture can fit into the environment. Moreover, the construction material of the building are mainly sandstone and glass, in order to suit the environment further.</p>
